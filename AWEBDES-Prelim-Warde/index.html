                <p class="lead">We're betting you do too. Welcome to our site, a growing collection of galleries taken
                    by a small
                    group of passionate urban photographers. Visit our galleries, buy some of our prints, or drop us a
                    line. While
                    you're at it, feel free ro submit a gallery of your own. <strong>Welcome.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Welcome to Desolve</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>So what is Desolve? The short answer is that it comes from the combination of
                        <strong>design</strong> and <strong>evolve</strong>, something we hope we're doing constantly.
                        A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of photographers, designers, and creatives
                        who enjoy urban photography.
                        During our travels around the country, we take time to document the cities we love.
                        You'll also occasionally find articles on design, our thoughts on the latest trends, and the odd
                        posting on photography.</p>
                    <h3>So... what arenâ€™t we?</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Professional photographers, for one. Please keep in mind that we're strictly amateur
                        photographers.
                        We submit these galleries out of love and creative expression. We're not likely to remember the
                        settings we took the picture at, or even what lens we had.
                        We're also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here, and want to participate, we'd love
                        to have you. All galleries, articles, and posts go through a submittal
                        and approval process, so if you're interested, drop us a line and tell us what you have in mind.
                        We also occasionally have meetups. If, for example, we know we're coming to Miami, we'll let
                        everyone know and schedule a meet up day to tour the city and take photos.
                        If you'd like us to visit your city,
                        <a href="#" class="link-warning">let us know!</a>
